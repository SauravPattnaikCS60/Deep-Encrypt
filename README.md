# Deep-Encrypt

(Worked with [Samarendra Dash](https://github.com/Samarendra109))

This project uses the concepts of enigma machine and huffman encoding to create encrypted texts.
First it uses the enigma machine system concept to encode the
text and then uses Huffman Encoding on the resultant text. While decoding the reverse is done.

Further the entire project is converted to an executable file as well.
